(Possibly not very far, depending on the output type; plaintext output, for instance, isn't capable of very much)
<p>There are two basic methods, <b><code>i-call</code></b> and <b><code>i-glist</code></b>
Both have the output language as first argument.</p>
<a name="i-glist"><h3>i-glist (lang way list)</h3></a>Makes a interface/markup as close as possible in the output language as
described in the 'way'.
<p>This is GILs equivalent to tags, except that the tags are replaced by general objects.</p>
<a name="i-call"><h3>i-prep (lang object)</h3></a>Makes interface/markup as close as possible to the language.
<p>It is to funcall functions directly.</p>
You don't use these directly, are functions that compose these for you. <code>glist</code> and <code>glist-list</code> do this, they also wrap in a lambda.
This way, the resulting function is independent on the <code>*lang*</code>
special variable. Basically, it is an object to describe the function in the raw,
to be exported the <code>*lang*</code> when it is <code>call</code>ed with it.
<a name="objects"><h2>Objects</h2></a>So then the important question is what sort of objects. Here are some pretty basic ones:
<ul style="DISC"><li>Lists are given by the class dot-list (TODO misnomer) but can also
be obtained via
<b>:point-list, :alt-list, :numbered-list</b> etcetera.</li><li>Sections, similar to that of those Latex. Sections can also be used
to make separate pages for websites.</li><li>Classes and associated functions indicating headers, bold,
italic etcetera.</li><li>Tables</li><li>Styles (based on css)</li><li>Image-file</li></ul>
