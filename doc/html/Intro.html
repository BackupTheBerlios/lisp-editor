However, i
didn't work very project-focussed and made a bunch of other stuff, making the aim more about gui/markup and autodocumentation.
<b>Currently GIL is the main project.</b>
<p>It is far from 'polished', for instance, i haven't figured out the best way to inferfere with the automatic contents page to the left; the
regular and packages entries arent separated. Also the autodoc results
could use improvement and optional manual entering of extra documentation. (Actually the doc-string itself is also manually entered, but it is just good habit to fill those.)</p>
<p>Also some would want to see this page black on white. I prefer it this
way. It would be nice to be able to add a button to just allow the choice.</p>
<a name="GIL"><h2>General Interface Library/Language</h2></a><p>I  
was annoyed that autodoc(see below) could only output in one language. I also simply felt that we needn't have separation between markup, web, and gui, and that Code=data should be 'Code as manifested
in function usuage'=data.</p>
<p>As such, i made/am making a library that allows one to specify
documents/guiworks just with methods and functions.(Macros might be
useful enough to include, but i'll mostly avoid them.) The methods
are mostly distinguished for purposes of indicating meaning.
Objects inputted determine the actual content. For instance, strings
represent text. See <a href="GIL.html#GIL">at 'GIL'</a> for more.</p>
<a name="Scanning code"><h2>Scanning code</h2></a>Scanning of the code is done in two separate parts:
<ul style="DISC"><li>An implementation of an expression-hook, it effectively reimplements
CLs macroexpansion for this.</li><li>A scanner that collects information based on the hook. As it works
with an expression hook, and macro function called in any way can be
automatically documented, if instructed how to document it.</li></ul>
It can be extended by writing expression-hooks.

<a href="DEFPACKAGE_EXPRESSION-HOOK.html#DEFPACKAGE_EXPRESSION-HOOK">Expression-hook</a>.
<a name="Autodocumentation"><h2>Autodocumentation</h2></a>Based on the scan data, so can make documentation from any expression useage. Being annoyed by LML2, and being able to output only html, i made GIL. As described above.
<p>The autodocumentation is extensible by writing document methods and hooks to gather information. Should have better documentation by default though; no documentation of methods, classes etcetera yet.
Also allowing the user to extend documentation aside would be nice.</p>
