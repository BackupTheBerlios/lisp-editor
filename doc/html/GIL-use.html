<a name="Conventions"><h2>Conventions</h2></a>The most important convention is that any function that works on gil-code accepts that prepared/gone-through glist gil-code as the &rest
last arguments.
<a name="Notation"><h2>Notation</h2></a><p>The basic lisp notation is less efficient one would want. Particularly
the \ and " needed everywhere is cumbersome. I made a parser that reads s-expressions a little differently, turning parts into strings
for you. All statements are still effectively function useage; you can
still just use it as lisp. It seems likely that the alternative notation is more useful if the
'code' is more data-like, and that
CL notation is more useful when the code is more 'code-like'.</p>
<p>It basically works by taking everything directly after '(' to be
a symbol, and always turning numbers into numbers. Otherwise it is always a string.
'\' escapes for a single charactere,
$ reads a lisp expression as usual, and  makes a statement a unit onto itself; if you want "a b c d" to be read as "a b" "c d", you'd do "a b c d".
This is often useful when you are filling the 'object' argument of a function. specifically it turns into <code>(glist :series ...)</code></p>
<p>The notation also takes
<code>{stuff...}</code> as <code>(denest stuff...)</code></p>
<p>Optional closing tags for readability on long s-expressions are still
todo.</p> 
<p>Note that Lisp, defining functions to do stuff for you is a tool to help you write.
(Although perhaps i will make other types of tools.)</p>
<a name="GIL-fun-use"><h2>Functions from user-perspective</h2></a>Firstly, <b>don't</b> use any of the 'i-...' functions, in data-like code
these are meant, and if you do, always make the second argument gil:*lang*, that is how the language is passed.
(Which is later deferred to a
<a href="http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/variables.html#dynamic-aka-special-variables">special variable</a>.)
<p>You can define your own functions to suit your needs.</p>
TODO further docs.
