</p>
<p>
 Recursively applies the function FN to all files within the
directory named by the non-wild pathname designator DIRNAME and all of
its sub-directories.  FN will only be applied to files for which the
function TEST returns a true value.  If DIRECTORIES is not NIL, FN and
TEST are applied to directories as well.  If DIRECTORIES is :DEPTH-FIRST,
FN will be applied to the directory's contents first.  If
DIRECTORIES is :BREADTH-FIRST and TEST returns NIL, the
directory's content will be skipped. IF-DOES-NOT-EXIST must be
one of :ERROR or :IGNORE where :ERROR means that an error will be
signaled if the directory DIRNAME does not exist.

</a>
<p>
  (   pathspec   )
</p>
<p>
 Converts the non-wild pathname designator PATHSPEC to file form.

   <h1>
    defun     pathname-as-directory    (      pathspec     )
  </h1>

</a>
<p>
  (   pathspec   )
</p>
<p>
 Converts the non-wild pathname designator PATHSPEC to directory
form.

<a name="DEFUN LIST-DIRECTORY">
   <h1>
    defun     list-directory    (      dirname     )
  </h1>

</a>
<p>
  (   dirname   )
</p>
<p>
 Returns a fresh list of pathnames corresponding to the truenames of
all files within the directory named by the non-wild pathname
designator DIRNAME.  The pathnames of sub-directories are returned in
directory form - see PATHNAME-AS-DIRECTORY.

<a name="DEFUN FILE-EXISTS-P">
   <h1>
    defun     file-exists-p    (      pathspec     )
  </h1>

</a>
<p>
  (   pathspec   )
</p>
<p>
 Checks whether the file named by the pathname designator PATHSPEC
exists and returns its truename if this is the case, NIL otherwise.
The truename is returned in `canonical' form, i.e. the truename of a
directory is returned as if by PATHNAME-AS-DIRECTORY.
</p>

<a name="DEFUN DIRECTORY-PATHNAME-P">
   <h1>
    defun     directory-pathname-p    (      pathspec     )
  </h1>

</a>
<p>
  (   pathspec   )
</p>
<p>
 Returns NIL if PATHSPEC (a pathname designator) does not designate
a directory, PATHSPEC otherwise.  It is irrelevant whether file or
directory designated by PATHSPEC does actually exist.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<a name="DEFUN DIRECTORY-EXISTS-P">
   <h1>
    defun     directory-exists-p    (      pathspec     )
  </h1>

</a>
<p>
  (   pathspec   )
</p>
<p>
 Checks whether the file named by the pathname designator PATHSPEC
exists and if it is a directory.  Returns its truename if this is the
case, NIL otherwise.  The truename is returned in directory form as if
by PATHNAME-AS-DIRECTORY.
</p>

<a name="DEFUN DELETE-DIRECTORY-AND-FILES">
   <h1>
    defun     delete-directory-and-files    (      dirname     )
  </h1>

</a>
<p>
  (   dirname   )
</p>
<p>
 Recursively deletes all files and directories within the directory
designated by the non-wild pathname designator DIRNAME including
DIRNAME itself.  IF-DOES-NOT-EXIST must be one of :ERROR or :IGNORE
where :ERROR means that an error will be signaled if the directory
DIRNAME does not exist.

<a name="DEFUN COPY-STREAM">
   <h1>
    defun     copy-stream    (      from       to     )
  </h1>

</a>
<p>
  (   from    to   )
</p>
<p>
 Copies into TO (a stream) from FROM (also a stream) until the end
of FROM is reached, in blocks of *stream-buffer-size*.  The streams
should have the same element type.  If CHECKP is true, the streams are
checked for compatibility of their types.

<a name="DEFUN COPY-FILE">
   <h1>
    defun     copy-file    (      from       to       overwrite     )

</a>
<p>
  (   from    to    overwrite   )
</p>
<p>
 Copies the file designated by the non-wild pathname designator FROM
to the file designated by the non-wild pathname designator TO.  If
OVERWRITE is true overwrites the file designtated by TO if it exists.
</p>
