==== defun walk-directory(dirname fn directories )
====

(dirname fn directories )

Recursively applies the function FN to all files within the
 directory named by the non-wild pathname designator DIRNAME
 and all of its sub-directories. FN will only be applied to
 files for which the function TEST returns a true value. If
 DIRECTORIES is not NIL, FN and TEST are applied to directories
 as well. If DIRECTORIES is :DEPTH-FIRST, FN will be applied to
 the directory's contents first. If DIRECTORIES is :BREADTH
-FIRST and TEST returns NIL, the directory's content will be
 skipped. IF-DOES-NOT-EXIST must be one of :ERROR or :IGNORE
 where :ERROR means that an error will be signaled if the
 directory DIRNAME does not exist.


==== defun pathname-as-file(pathspec )
====

(pathspec )

Converts the non-wild pathname designator PATHSPEC to file
 form.


==== defun pathname-as-directory(pathspec )
====

(pathspec )

Converts the non-wild pathname designator PATHSPEC to directory
 form.


==== defun list-directory(dirname )
====

(dirname )

Returns a fresh list of pathnames corresponding to the
 truenames of all files within the directory named by the non
-wild pathname designator DIRNAME. The pathnames of sub
-directories are returned in directory form - see PATHNAME-AS
-DIRECTORY.


==== defun file-exists-p(pathspec )
====

(pathspec )

Checks whether the file named by the pathname designator
 PATHSPEC exists and returns its truename if this is the case,
 NIL otherwise. The truename is returned in `canonical' form,
 i.e. the truename of a directory is returned as if by PATHNAME
-AS-DIRECTORY.


==== defun directory-pathname-p(pathspec )
====

(pathspec )

Returns NIL if PATHSPEC (a pathname designator) does not
 designate a directory, PATHSPEC otherwise. It is irrelevant
 whether file or directory designated by PATHSPEC does actually
 exist.


==== defun directory-exists-p(pathspec )
====

(pathspec )

Checks whether the file named by the pathname designator
 PATHSPEC exists and if it is a directory. Returns its truename
 if this is the case, NIL otherwise. The truename is returned
 in directory form as if by PATHNAME-AS-DIRECTORY.


==== defun delete-directory-and-files(dirname )
====

(dirname )

Recursively deletes all files and directories within the
 directory designated by the non-wild pathname designator
 DIRNAME including DIRNAME itself. IF-DOES-NOT-EXIST must be
 one of :ERROR or :IGNORE where :ERROR means that an error will
 be signaled if the directory DIRNAME does not exist.


==== defun copy-stream(from to )
====

(from to )

Copies into TO (a stream) from FROM (also a stream) until the
 end of FROM is reached, in blocks of *stream-buffer-size*. The
 streams should have the same element type. If CHECKP is true,
 the streams are checked for compatibility of their types.


==== defun copy-file(from to overwrite )
====

(from to overwrite )

Copies the file designated by the non-wild pathname designator
 FROM to the file designated by the non-wild pathname
 designator TO. If OVERWRITE is true overwrites the file
 designtated by TO if it exists.
